<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! My name is Adeeba Maheen, and I’m currently a student learning web development.
I started studying web technologies because I enjoy creating interactive and user‑friendly websites. My current focus is on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I am also beginning to explore frameworks like React.</p>

<p>During my course, I’ve worked on small projects such as building responsive web pages and simple web applications. These experiences have helped me understand both the design aspects and the technical logic behind websites.</p>

<p>Apart from coding, I’m interested in UI/UX design and in learning how to make websites more accessible and engaging. In the future, I aspire to work as a front‑end developer where I can contribute to creative projects while continuing to develop my technical skills.</p>
